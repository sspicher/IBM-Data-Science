    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    " There are over 200 named neighborhoods in Atlanta, each with a unique history and culture. Sadly, for a long time these neighborhoods were isolated from each other. The Atlanta Beltline project aims to correct that by providing easy walking paths around the city. These pathways have seen exploding business and cultural growth since construction.\n",
    "I am from Atlanta, GA and have always loved beer, so I am always on the look out for new beer serving establishments. But what would it look like to start my own? Would the Beltline help? Would I get drowned out by other bars or restaurants?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Business Problem\n",
    "If I want to open a beer taproom in Atlanta, where should I put it? Where would I get the best value for my money while also reaching the most popular neighborhoods. By using population and FourSquare data, can I see which neighborhoods have the fewest beer serving establishments per capita?\n",

    "## 3.2 Atlanta Neighborhood Population\n",

The page is here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Atlanta_neighborhoods_by_population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Atlanta_neighborhoods_by_population).\n",

    "## 3.3 FourSquare API Data\n",
    "Using the FourSquare API, I will gather the number of beer serving venues in each Neighborhood. Since I am using the a free license with FourSquare I will limit the queries to venues and not menus. Expected data we will retrieve is:\n",

Obviously, there are other things to consider like space availability, rent, access, etc. This analysis was designed to be more of a first pass on which neighborhoods show a desnity of venues like the one I would like to open.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ideally, I would have searched FourSquare using the neighborhood names themselves. I tried this but got many errors and saw that there was a misalignment with the names of Atlanta neighborhoods as the city seems them and what is reported in FourSquare. To overcome this, I simply used the central latitudes and longitudes for each neighbood and searched around a certain raidus from those points. We probably missed some venues using this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Atlanta is known as a sprawling city with many people driving in and out of the city-proper and its neighborhoods to go about their lives. I also already mentioned the Atlanta Beltline project as a means to connect the various neighborhoods. Basing this decision on reported population is likely missing the true story of the average daily person count in a particular neighborhood. I would like to improve this model with this data if it were available."
